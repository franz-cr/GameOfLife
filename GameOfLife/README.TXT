RULES:
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal 
grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive 
or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts with its eight 
neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or 
diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused 
    by underpopulation.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next 
    generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by 
    overpopulation.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if 
    by reproduction.
    - The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first 
    generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every 
    cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete 
    moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, 
    each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). 
    - The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

ORIGINS:
Conway was interested in a problem presented in the 1940s by mathematician John 
von Neumann, who attempted to find a hypothetical machine that could build copies 
of itself and succeeded when he found a mathematical model for such a machine 
with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid. The Game of Life emerged as 
Conway's successful attempt to drastically simplify von Neumann's ideas.

The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of Scientific 
American, in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column. From a theoretical point 
of view, it is interesting because it has the power of a universal Turing machine: 
that is, anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within 
Conway's Game of Life.[2][3] Gardner wrote:

The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a whole new field 
of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata ... Because of Life's 
analogies with the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms, 
it belongs to a growing class of what are called "simulation games" (games that 
resemble real life processes).

Ever since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much interest, 
because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. Life provides 
an example of emergence and self-organization. Scholars in various fields, such 
as computer science, physics, biology, biochemistry, economics, mathematics, 
philosophy, and generative sciences have made use of the way that complex patterns 
can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules[citation needed]. 
The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat 
counterintuitive notion that "design" and "organization" can spontaneously emerge 
in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher and cognitive scientist 
Daniel Dennett has used the analogue of Conway's Life "universe" extensively to 
illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as 
consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic 
physical laws, which might govern our universe.
